# Hola! My name is Javier! ðŸ‘‹

<br />

I'm a fullstack software engineer from an island called Mallorca, located in Spain.

<br />

I created this blog to share my thoughts on a diverse range of topics, including technology, development and personal insights. I'll try to be short, but helpful, and provide a some value to our community.
