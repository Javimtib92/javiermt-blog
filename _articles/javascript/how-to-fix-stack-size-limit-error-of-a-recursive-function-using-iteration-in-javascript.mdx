One day at work I had to walk through a complex data structure to remove some circular references (Contentful CMS and linked entries anyone?) and stumbled upon this error:

```bash
RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded (Chrome)
InternalError: too much recursion (Firefox)
RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded. (Safari)

# Some browsers are a bit more human than others at telling you the bad news ðŸ‘€
```

I was using a fancy recursive function to traverse this data and I got hit by the max call stack size defined for the node process.
Bummer. The worst thing is that this compromised production and because we didn't add error handling to this function our users were experiencing a Black Screen of Death.

By the end of this article <Highlight color="blue">you will learn how to avoid this situation by converting a recursive function into its iterative counterpart</Highlight>.
But first I will give you a small introduction to the recursive approach.

## The shape of disaster, the recursive attempt

For reference, this is a simplified version of the code that caused all this mess:

```js title="normalize.js"
function normalizeObject(object) {
  if (Array.isArray(object)) {
    for (const item of object) {
      normalizeObject(item);
    }
  } else if (object !== null && typeof object === 'object') {
    for (const property in object) {
      // We are doing things here to check candidates for circular references and remove them. Like the following:
      // if (object[property]?.sys?.id === 'internalLink') {
      //   delete object[property].page;
      // }
      normalizeObject(object[property]);
    }
  }
}

normalizeObject(complexObject);
```

The recursion to walk this object tree is simple, some properties might be Array and some others might be Object &mdash;array and null are of type object in Javascript that's why we check that is not null&mdash;. We don't do anything for functions or primitive types.

If the current recursive call value is an Array we loop through it and call the recursion
on each element. On the other hand, if the current value is an Object we loop through
every property and call the recursive function on it's value.

If the initial Object is very deep and has a lot of properties then you can get hit by the Stack-Size limit error.

## Buckle up, things are going to get interesting

After some research I found a node v8 option to increase the stack size called **--stack-size**
but that didn't feel right. I have nothing against that option, if it solves the
problem it should be fine, right? But that flag is unreliable as discussed in [this github issue](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/6360).

So, back to our problem solving, after some more research I came across [this article](https://exploringjs.com/es6/ch_tail-calls.html) about **tail call optimization**.

> ECMAScript 6 offers tail call optimization, where you can make some function calls without growing the call stack.

Well, that looks promising BUT seconds later I got hit by reality. ðŸ¤¯

> Warning: Even though tail call optimization is part of the language specification, it isnâ€™t supported by many engines and that may never change.

Back to square one, I had to find an alternative and that's when I found out that a recursive function could be translated to an iterative version.

## Our well-known buddy, the iteration

The concept for the iterative approach is simple, <Highlight color="blue">it uses a stack or queue to sequentially process elements of a data structure without recursion</Highlight>.

```js title="normalize.js"
function normalizeObject(object) {
  let queue = [object];

  while (queue.length) {
    const current = queue.shift();

    if (Array.isArray(current)) {
      queue = [...queue, ...current];
    }

    if (current !== null && typeof current === 'object') {
      for (const property in current) {
        // We are doing things here to check candidates for circular references and remove them. Like the following:
        // if (object[property]?.sys?.id === 'internalLink') {
        //   delete object[property].page;
        // }
        queue.push(current[property]);
      }
    }
  }
}

...

normalizeObject(complexObject);
```

That's how I fixed our Stack-Size Limit error. There might be other alternatives I haven't discovered yet
but that solution worked well for our use-case.

To wrap up, in this article, we saw that recursion can throw an error if objects
are too complex and the call stack of the recursion grows massively. We analyzed
the function that caused this error and went through a real-world example of how
we approached the solution. From discovering TCO, figuring out that not all engines
where onboard with tail call optimization, to eventually realizing that the same
function could be written using an iteration which finally solved our problem.

Be careful though and always analyze your problem because, for us, iterative
approach was sometimes slower than recursion depending on the operations done inside and other factors I don't fully understand.

But that doesn't matter if the recursion throws an error right? ðŸ˜„

## Bonus

If you want to test this out you can create the following file:

```js title="recursion-test.js"
const createDeeplyNestedObject = (depth, currentDepth = 0) => {
  if (currentDepth === depth) {
    return 'Reached maximum depth';
  }

  return {
    nestedObject: createDeeplyNestedObject(depth, currentDepth + 1),
  };
};

const iterativeReplacer = (value) => {
  let queue = [value];

  while (queue.length) {
    const current = queue.shift();

    if (Array.isArray(current)) {
      queue = [...queue, ...current];
    } else if (current !== null && typeof current === 'object') {
      for (const property in current) {
        queue.push(current[property]);
      }
    }
  }
};

const recursiveReplacer = (value) => {
  if (Array.isArray(value)) {
    for (const item of value) {
      recursiveReplacer(item);
    }
  } else if (value !== null && typeof value === 'object') {
    for (const property in value) {
      recursiveReplacer(value[property]);
    }
  }
};

(() => {
  /**
   *  I manually tweaked the depth of this object to avoid a Stack-Size limit
   *  in the recursive function that creates the object.
   *
   *  Adjust the depth number for different results.
   */
  const deeplyNestedObject = createDeeplyNestedObject(6000);

  const startRecursive = performance.now();

  try {
    recursiveReplacer(deeplyNestedObject);

    console.log('\x1b[32m%s\x1b[0m', 'Recursive function succeed');
  } catch (e) {
    console.log('\x1b[31m%s\x1b[0m', 'Recursive function failed');
  } finally {
    const endRecursive = performance.now();
    const timeSpent = endRecursive - startRecursive;

    console.log(`Time spent processing: ${timeSpent} milliseconds`);
  }

  console.log('-------------');

  const startIterative = performance.now();

  try {
    iterativeReplacer(deeplyNestedObject);

    console.log('\x1b[32m%s\x1b[0m', 'Iterative function succeed');
  } catch (e) {
    console.log('\x1b[31m%s\x1b[0m', 'Iterative function failed');
  } finally {
    const endIterative = performance.now();
    const timeSpent = endIterative - startIterative;

    console.log(`Time spent processing: ${timeSpent} milliseconds`);
  }
})();
```

Running node to execute this file will lead to the following result:

```bash
node recursion-test.js

Recursive function failed
Time spent processing: 5.062059998512268 milliseconds
-------------
Iterative function succeed
Time spent processing: 4.321290999650955 milliseconds
```
