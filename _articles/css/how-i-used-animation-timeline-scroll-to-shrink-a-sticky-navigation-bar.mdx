In this post we'll look through how to build a navigation bar that sticks to the top and shrinks in size when user scrolls down. <Highlight>I've used this technique to build the navigation bar for Coding Kittens.</Highlight>

I wanted the logo and the navigation menu to stand out and be always visible so I've added a considerable height to the navigation bar. Then while testing the site on my phone I noticed that the navigation bar was occuping a lot of the reading space, specially on my 4,7 inches phone. ðŸ˜“

<ImageCard id="image01" key="image01" src={image01} width={250} height={450} caption={{ text: 'Navbar occupies a big percentage of the screen on small devices'}}/>


I decided to decrease the navigation bar height after user scrolls down. The simple solution is easy. Something like this could do the job: 

```js
// When the user scrolls down 80px from the top of the document, resize the navbar's padding and the logo's font size
window.onscroll = function() {scrollFunction()};

function scrollFunction() {
  if (document.body.scrollTop > 80 || document.documentElement.scrollTop > 80) {
    document.getElementById("navbar").style.padding = "30px 10px";
    document.getElementById("logo").style.fontSize = "25px";
  } else {
    document.getElementById("navbar").style.padding = "80px 10px";
    document.getElementById("logo").style.fontSize = "35px";
  }
}
```

The problem is... where is the fun in doing it like this? Coding Kittens is my space to experiment and test new things. <Highlight>I wanted to find something more performant, extensible and CSS-only.</Highlight>

We'll use some experimental features that are not supported on all browsers. Most of the things we'll use have above 96% support according to [Can I use](https://caniuse.com/). The `animation-timeline:scroll` though is far less supported but we'll add a JavaScript fallback for it.

We'll start by explaining shortly what `animation-timeline:scroll` is.

## Scroll function and ScrollTimeline explained

The `scroll` function is a CSS function that can be used along with `animation-timeline` to animate the current element based on scroll axis and target. You can find more about how it works in the MDN documentation page: [animation-timeline:scroll()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation-timeline/scroll#browser_compatibility)

With the `scroll` function you attach a `ScrollTimeline` instance to an element to track the progress of the scroll animation.

```css
#element {
  animation-name: animation;
  animation-duration: 1ms;
  animation-timeline: scroll();
}
```
The `scroll` function can accept two parameters, the `scroller` and the `axis`.

```css
#element {
  animation-name: animation;
  animation-duration: 1ms;
  animation-timeline: scroll(block nearest);
}
```

The `scroller` defines the element that will provide the scroll progress timeline.

The `axis` defines to what scroll direction it tracks progress of.

Imagine it as attaching a scroll listener to an element without JavaScript.

You can specify the scrolling range within the animation takes place using the `animation-range` property.

```css
#element {
  animation-name: animation;
  animation-duration: 1ms;
  animation-timeline: scroll(block nearest);
  animation-range-start: 0%;
  animation-range-end: 10%;
}
```

With this simple code we can animate something on scroll. Now lets see how to use this to animate a Navigation bar.

## Are you a Wizard?

The Navigation Bar I styled for this example has the following structure:

```html title="index.html"
... html code here
<nav class="navbar">
  <div class="backdrop"></div>
  <div class="inner-container">
    <a href="/" class="logo-link">
      <!--Logo SVG or image goes here -->       
      <div class="site-name">
        <p>Your site</p>
      </div>
    </a>
    <div class="navigation-links">
      <div class="navigation-links-inner">
        <a>Home</a>
        <a>Blog</a>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</nav>
... more html code here
```

And the styles for this navbar are the following.

```css title="styles.css"
.navbar {
    display: flex;
    position: sticky;
    padding: 1rem 0.5rem;
    margin-bottom: 3rem;
    margin-top: 5rem;
    flex-direction: row;
    align-items: flex-start;
    top: -1px;
  
    @media (min-width: 768px) {
      padding: 1rem 1.25rem;
    }
  }
  
  .backdrop {
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
    min-width: 100%;
    height: 5rem;
    backdrop-filter: blur(8px);
    left: -8px;
    right: -8px;
  
    @media (min-width: 768px) {
      margin-right: -28px;
      margin-left: -28px;
    }
  }

  .inner-container {
    display: flex;
    z-index: 10;
    margin-left: 0;
    flex-direction: row;
    justify-content: space-between;
    min-width: 100%;
  }
  
  .logo {
    margin-right: 1rem;
  }
  
  .logo-link {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: row;
    align-items: center;
    text-decoration: none;
  }
  
  .site-name {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
  }
  
  .site-name p {
    color: white;
    margin: 0;
    font-size: 1.5rem;
    line-height: 2rem;
    font-weight: 700;
  
    @media (min-width: 640px) {
      font-size: 1.5rem;
      line-height: 2rem;
    }
  }
  
  .navigation-links {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: row-reverse;
    gap: 1.5rem;
  
    @media (min-width: 640px) {
      flex-direction: row;
    }
  }
  
  .navigation-links-inner {
    display: none;
    flex-direction: row;
    align-items: center;
  
    @media (min-width: 640px) {
      display: flex;
    }
  }
  
  .navigation-links-inner a {
    position: relative;
    padding: 0.25rem 0.5rem;
  }
```

You can see it in action in this code sandbox:

<CodeSandbox files={
  getFiles({ animationStyles: false})
} />

Now we have our first version of the navbar. It doesn't animate and occupies a considerable amount of the screen. We can do better.

We are going to apply some CSS magic to it.

```css title="styles.css"
@keyframes shrink { /* [!code focus]*/
  0% {/* [!code focus]*/
    --navbar-shrink: 0;/* [!code focus]*/
  }/* [!code focus]*/
  50%,/* [!code focus]*/
  100% {/* [!code focus]*/
    --navbar-shrink: 1;/* [!code focus]*/
  }/* [!code focus]*/
}/* [!code focus]*/

.navbar {
    display: flex;
    position: sticky;
    padding: 1rem 0.5rem;
    margin-bottom: 3rem;
    margin-top: 5rem;
    flex-direction: row;
    align-items: flex-start;
    top: -1px;
  
    @media (min-width: 768px) {
      padding: 1rem 1.25rem;
    }

    --navbar-shrink: 1; /* [!code focus]*/
    animation: shrink; /* [!code focus]*/
    animation-timing-function: ease; /* [!code focus]*/
    animation-timeline: scroll(root block); /* [!code focus]*/
    animation-range-start: 0%; /* [!code focus]*/
    animation-range-end: 10%; /* [!code focus]*/
}
```

I'll explain step by step what we are doing here:

1. First we define our animation `keyframes` that our scroll animation will use. The keyframes will change a CSS variable called `--navbar-shrink`. We'll use this value as our `boolean` to toggle shrink on and off.

2. Then we intialize `--navbar-shrink` to `1`

3. We assign `shrink` to be the animation.

4. As timing function we will use `ease`, but you can use anything you want.

5. We define the `animation-timeline` to call the `scroll` CSS function with **root** as the `scrollable` and **block** as the `axis`.

6. Then we specify that the range of this animation will be between `0%` and `10%` of the page scroll. <Highlight>You can play with this values and the keyframe intermediate steps to animate on the scroll position you want.</Highlight>


What we did here is changing a CSS property based on how much we scrolled down and this allows us to have two different states for the navbar styles. How cool is that?

Now we are able to apply some magic like this:


```css title="styles.css"
...

.navbar .inner-container {
  transition: transform 0.3s ease;
  transform: translateY(calc(0px - var(--navbar-shrink) * 12px));
}
.navbar .backdrop {
  transition: transform 0.3s ease;
  transform: translateY(calc(0px - var(--navbar-shrink) * 24px));
}

.navbar svg {
  transition: transform 0.3s ease;
  transform: scale(calc(1 - var(--navbar-shrink) * 0.2));
}

.navbar h1, .navbar p {
  transition: opacity 0.3s ease;
  opacity: calc(1 - var(--navbar-shrink));
}
...
```

I'm using the CSS property along with the `calc` CSS function to dynamically compute the values of these styles. I can scale the logo, change the height of the container by moving the inner-container off the screen, change the opacity of text. Anything.

## Dude, I'm using the oldest version of Safari I can and this is not working

As I mentioned at the begining of this post, the `animation-timeline: scroll()` is not supported in all browsers. In fact by the time of writing this it's only supported in Chromium browsers.

Fear nothing, I have the solution for you. We'll do some changes to our CSS and add a bit of JavaScript. And before I continue, yes, the whole point of this was to avoid adding JavaScript, but there are other benefits to use the scroll CSS function. I will mention the benefits later on.

We'll start by adding a CSS Supports at rule to check if there's browser support.

```css title="styles.css"
.navbar {
    display: flex;
    position: sticky;
    padding: 1rem 0.5rem;
    margin-bottom: 3rem;
    margin-top: 5rem;
    flex-direction: row;
    align-items: flex-start;
    top: -1px;
  
    @media (min-width: 768px) {
      padding: 1rem 1.25rem;
    }

    @supports (animation-timeline: scroll()) {/* [!code focus]*/
      --navbar-shrink: 1;/* [!code focus]*/

      animation: shrink;/* [!code focus]*/
      animation-timeline: scroll(root block);/* [!code focus]*/
      animation-range-start: 0%;/* [!code focus]*/
      animation-range-end: 10%;/* [!code focus]*/
      animation-timing-function: ease;/* [!code focus]*/
    }/* [!code focus]*/
}
```

This will add the animation to the `.navbar` class only if the feature is supported by the browser.

Next if there's no support we need to toggle the `--navbar-shrink` property anyway as it is used in to dynamically change the styles of the navbar elements.

We'll add a bit of JavaScript at the bottom of the `nav` element so that it gets executed after the element is rendered into the page.

```html title="index.html" {23, 36, 38}
... html code here
<nav class="navbar">
  <div class="backdrop"></div>
  <div class="inner-container">
    <a href="/" class="logo-link">
      <!--Logo SVG or image goes here -->       
      <div class="site-name">
        <p>Your site</p>
      </div>
    </a>
    <div class="navigation-links">
      <div class="navigation-links-inner">
        <a>Home</a>
        <a>Blog</a>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</nav>
<script>/* [!code focus]*/
  (function () {/* [!code focus]*/
    const navbar = document.querySelector(".navbar");/* [!code focus]*/

    if (!CSS.supports("animation-timeline: scroll()")) {/* [!code focus]*/
      const threshold = 500; // Adjust this threshold as needed/* [!code focus]*/

      window.addEventListener("scroll", handleScroll);/* [!code focus]*/

      function handleScroll() {/* [!code focus]*/
        if (!navbar) {/* [!code focus]*/
          return;/* [!code focus]*/
        }/* [!code focus]*/

        const scrollY = window.scrollY || window.pageYOffset;/* [!code focus]*/

        if (scrollY > threshold) {/* [!code focus]*/
          navbar.style.setProperty("--navbar-shrink", "1");/* [!code focus]*/
        } else {/* [!code focus]*/
          navbar.style.setProperty("--navbar-shrink", "0");/* [!code focus]*/
        }/* [!code focus]*/
      }/* [!code focus]*/
    }/* [!code focus]*/
  })();/* [!code focus]*/
</script>/* [!code focus]*/
... more html code here
```

Now we have a fully supported animation for the Navigation bar!

You can play with it in the following CodeSandbox.

<CodeSandbox files={
  getFiles({ animationStyles: true})
} />

The problem with it is that when there's no scrollable content the `animation-timeline: scroll()` triggers as if the content was scrolled through. I didn't find an official way to disable this behavior but I did find a trick to avoid it.
