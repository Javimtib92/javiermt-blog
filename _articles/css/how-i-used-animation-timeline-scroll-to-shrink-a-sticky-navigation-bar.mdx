We are trying to build a navigation that sticks to the top and on further scrolling it shrinks it's height. Everything with a smooth animation that doesn't make the UI look junky

## Scroll function and ScrollTimeline explained

The `scroll` function is a CSS function that can be used along with `animation-timeline` to animate the current element based on scroll axis and target. You can find more about how it works in the MDN docs: [animation-timeline:scroll()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation-timeline/scroll#browser_compatibility)

With the `scroll` function you define that an element will have a `ScrollTimeline` which will track the progress of the scroll animation.

The `scroll` function accepts two parameters, the `scroller` and the `axis`.

The `scroller` defines the element that will provide the scroll progress timeline.

The `axis` defines to what scroll direction it tracks progress of.

Imagine it as attaching a scroll listener to an element without JavaScript.
